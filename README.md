## Introduction
Reconstruction code for respiration resolved SWEEP acquisitions. The code presented here is a builds upon the reconstructiion pipeline described in the paper below. If you find this code useful please acknowledge this paper (in press).

An outline of the reconstruction pipeline is given in the figure below. For more details please refer to the paper given above.

## Example
```
Usage:
     sweeprecon -i path_to_nii <optional args>
     
     Optional arguments:
     --thickness <float>       :: thickness of acquisition slices in mm (default 4mm)
     --nstates <int>           :: number of respiration states to receonstruct to (defualt 4)
     --recon_thickness <float> :: thickness of reconstructed slices in mm (default isotropic)
     --redo                    :: flag to redo processing from scratch
     --resort_only             :: flag to stop processing after resort step
     --crop <float>            :: factor to crop from either side of image for bodyarea mask (default 0.2)
```
